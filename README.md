# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Barbara Rodas, my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I am a first-year. I became interested in video games at a young age by watching Youtubers even though I never owned a console. As I grew older, I was able to purchase a virtual realty headset, which has further pushed my interest in games. I am especially curious about virtual reality games and story-based games. Some of my favorite games includes I Expect You to Die, Detroit: Become Human, and Genshin Impact. I am taking this course as part of my major in hopes to learn more about creating games. I am especially curious in creating virtual reality games in my future. 

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I hope to learn a coding language for the first time and to further understand the thought process behind creating and coding video games. 

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I am mainly nervous if I will be able to pick up and understand the programming and coding language(s) that we will be learning. 

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

I have touched a bit with C+ or C#, but I'm not entirely sure which one, nor am I confident that I remember much about it. 

2. Game development (any engine)

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:
